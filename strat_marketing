Part 1:
     - Customer needs: (identifying a market = identifying a need)
       Mobility: concept that allow humans (and machines as well) to access the information they need, reproduce the info they generate in any place and in real time.

       Mobility concern each human being and the machines accompanying us.
       Over time, mobility will be so omnipresent that it will become part of our life.
       Mobility defines the need of easy and instant access to all types of knowledge.

       The need of Mobility requires cartographic modelling extended to the model known as the "Digital Earth".


     - Value Chain:
       The mapping of all necessary activities to build a successful sales - production process.

     - Value Proposition:
       The subjective worth of something and depends upon scarcity and desirability.
       	   Value = Benefits / costs


     - The Market definition:
       A market is represented by functionalities / technologies / types of clients.
       And is caracterized by competitors products / clients tupes / geographical criteria / different levels of production / distribution.


     - The Market dimension:
       Made of all the groups of consumers who will purchase the product.

       In the description of GEOD, the company wants to resolve the problem of Mobility in all over the world.


     - The Consumer groups:
       There is different categories of clients.

       In the description of GEOD they don't divide pototial clients into different groups, they simply say that it reach every being humans and in even machines in the future.


     - The Technologies chosen:
       Different technologies can be used to satisfy a need.

       "Viral" approch, based on consumers activity to collect data.


     - The Materials used:
       people's mind, to collect data :D
       Huge databases.
       Secure servers.


     - The functionalities offered:
       GEOD has been designed in response to huge needs in terms of modelling, necessary for the development of Mobility and secondly to enable applications to manage this real-time data.
       GEOD takes the form of a coherent software chain capable of solving problems related to world modelling.
       Main features are:
        - patial validity across the whole Earth and continuity in cartographic description.
	- “fractal” organisation of information, enabling quasi-instant access at any scale ranging from the whole Earth to the smallest piece of land.
	- organisation of cartographic data (formatting) for direct use in BCI’s Mobility application software.
	- organisation allowing the collection of cartographic data and database updates, in “viral” mode. (mainly to collect / update data from users)
	- Universality of the earth description mode, providing potential for an unlimited number of customised databases.
	- GEOD is an open system to which an unlimited number of Mobility applications can be “connected”, with GEOD managing the crucial aspect of cartographic modelling

       The company focus the development of the GEOD software chain on the following:
        - pedestrian version : the product GEOD’s eMM tool is used to collect data in viral mode.
	- multimodal version : to enable interrelations between different methods of transport.
	- professional version : to provide confidentiality/pertinence/authenticity to professional data.
	- customised version : allow unlimited, customised exchange of cartographic data.
	- 3D description of the world : precise 3D modelling of all the objects in our environment. BCI has already created the Mimesis aeronautical system based on the same principles.
	- “indoor” description : modelling building interiors in continuity with their exteriors.



     - Product:
       Dimension of quality: Tangible / Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy.

       GEOD (Gestion Evoluée d’Objets Diversifiés) aims to answers to the need of Mobility and world modelling.

     - Price:
       Capturing customer value receive from product / service.
       Goals:
       - Maximize sales growth.
       - Maintain quality or service differenciation.
       - Maximize current profit.
       - Survive !
       - Meet social objectives.

       The company doesn't say anything about price.


     - Place:
       Distribution channel : the set of interdependant organisation involved in the process of making a service available for consumption or use by consumers.
       Goals:
       - increase availabilty of product to user.
       - satisfy customer requirements with high leel of service.
       - ensure promotional effort
       - obtain timely and detailed market information
       - increase cost-effectiveness.
       - maintain flexibility.

       The company target emrging countries and specificaly India.
       Internet service providers and telecoms are involved in the delivery of the service.


     - Promotion:
       - advertising
       - personal selling
       - sales promotion
       - public relations
       Process: define the audience, Set promotional objectives, Set the promotion budget, Design the promotion mix, Evaluate the results.



Part 2:
     - Is the Market well defined?
       hmm, i would say that there is no market defined at all !!!
       The need is too much undefined.
       There is no competitors study.
       Every potential clients are in the same group exept maybe in different geographical areas.
       The market size is not defined. They don't say anything about the potencial clients.

       Besides the market definition, there is no market segmentation.
       But they seems to target emerging contries and specificaly India.

       No marketing strategies either.


     - Comment on BCI Navigation’s action in India and in Africa.
       They are making a join venture with a company in India. BCI wants to contribute to the development of the country.


Part 3: Give your recommendation(s).
     Stop saying bullshit, and present your fucking software. Sorry for the language, but this whole document doesn't say much...
